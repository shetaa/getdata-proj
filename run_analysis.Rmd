This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```{r "download",cache=T,eval=F }
#create directory, load the data zip file nad unzip it
unzip("getdata-projectfiles-UCI HAR Dataset.zip")

```{r "bine",cache=T,eval=F }
x_test <- read.fwf("UCI HAR Dataset\\test\\X_test.txt", widths=16, sep="", colClasses="numeric")

```
```{r "read",cache=T,eval=T }
#reading features to use as column headers
features <- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset\\features.txt", sep=" ")
features_mean_std <- (grepl("mean\\(\\)", features[,2]) | grepl("std\\(\\)", features[,2]))

#reading train files (only features in filtered_features)
# read.fwf allows skipping a field by specifying corresponding width value as negative.
# Here column width is 16, for columns for mean and std deviation we will provide width of 16, for others-16

getColWidth <- function(x){
    if(x)
        16
    else
       -16
}

width = 16 * (2*as.numeric(filtered_features_indexes)-1)
col_widths = apply(features_mean_std,1, getColWidth

feature_column_names <- as.character(features[,2])

#reading train filess

y_train <- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset\\train\\y_train.txt")
